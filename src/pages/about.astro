            <p class="text-lg font-regular font-serif mb-6">
                Currently living in Vienna, Austria, I am exploring as artist, educator and life-long learner the multifaceted relationships between music and movement in a variety of processes. I delight in taking on various roles in different projects: mainly composer, and also performing musician, teacher, choreographer, movement artist and researcher. Before moving to Vienna in November 2019, I worked for more than two decades in South Africa as composer and lecturer at the North-West University in Potchefstroom.
