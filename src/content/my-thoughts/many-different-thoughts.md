A large range of my thoughts on my life as composer was gathered and documented by [Jaco Meyer](https://www.jacomeyer.com/) in an interview. He published the interview online as a video which can be accessed on his website [here](https://www.jacomeyer.com/resources/composer-interview-series/4-hannes-taljaard). The interview was also published in a musicology journal, which can be downloaded [here](/assets/SAMUS-41_42-HT-Meyer-Interview.pdf).
