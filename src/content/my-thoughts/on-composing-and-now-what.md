It is unfortunately true for many composers that many compositions are performed only once. When
one thinks about the time and energy that are required to compose a work, and bring this into relation
with the few minutes of sound, it can be quite demotivating. Furthermore, one might not be satisfied
with the composition after its first performance, and then determining what one can do, can become
clouded by disappointment. This might lead to letting the piece fall out of mind, out of sight. Another
diagram helps me to keep perspective and motivation: a diagram that puts the first performance of a
composition into a flow-diagram that includes as many activities as I could imagine.
