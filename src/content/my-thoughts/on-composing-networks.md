The professional life of a composer requires many hours of solo work. For some composers the
possibilities of cooperating with others, and of working in a network, are attractive and stimulating.
For many years, my professional activities were too much ‘solo’ and too little ‘tutti’. And so, I
thought about this, and tried to imagine all the different groups of people with whom I can cooperate.
I made a diagram, as a way of encouraging myself to keep on dreaming about and working towards
professional work that would progressively include others.
