Movement artist and choreographer<br><br>
Our performance opened a long concert that highlighted the work of the pedagogical
institutes at the mdw. Students from our institute under the guidance of Prof Meike Schmitz
developed choreographies for Circusmuziek by Ton der Doest for Woodwind Quintet –
performed live. To accompany the music of the seventh movement, I developed a concept for
a movement improvisation with materials by the whole movement ensemble – a
multicoloured cloth and a variety of balls. My aim was to present three of the four means of
RhythmicsMM in a playful way: music, movement, and materials.
