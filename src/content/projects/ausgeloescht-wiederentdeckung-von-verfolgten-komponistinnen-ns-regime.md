Students and lecturers from the mdw worked with the music of seven female composers who
were persecuted by the Nazi’s and whose work and names were almost forgotten. The aim of
the project was to present the wide stylistic range of the compositions, and to encourage
musicians to present the works more often. Students from our institute for music and
movement education worked on two contrasting compositions and in contrasting ways under
the guidance of Irmgard Bankl. My roles took as foundations my analyses of the
compositions and my responsibility for structuring parts of the rehearsals based on the
experiences of the group of movement artists. For Rêverie for piano by Germain Taillefaire
we developed a concept for a structured movement improvisation that took as its basic
inspiration the common denominators of our experiences of opposing forces in the music. For
the third movement of Trialogues by Wally Weigl (for flute, viola and harp), we developed a
choreography in the tradition of plastique animé. Our aim with this choreography were to
clarify the tonal and thematic processes of the composition.
