Performance: Wednesday 15 May, Brick-15, Vienna
I worked as choreographer for the first piece on the programme (Reflejos Distantes by Karola
Oberm√ºller) and as movement artist in three more performances.

The transdisciplinary project KORZINTHIO combined music and movement to create a
multisensory experience for the participating artists (almost twenty students and three
lecturers at the University of Music and performing Arts Vienna) and the audience. The
exchange between different disciplines created new perspectives and inspired participants to
go beyond the boundaries of traditional artistic practices. KORZINTHIO explored the music
of female composers from the Middle Ages, the Renaissance and our time.
