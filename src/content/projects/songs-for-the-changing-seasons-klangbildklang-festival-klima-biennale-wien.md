Where, when and how are the changes to our planet be expressed? How will the expression sound? Five students of the Department of Music and Movement Education/Rhythmics of the University of Music and performing Arts Vienna (under the guidance of Milly Groz) presented improvisations inspired by an art exposition that formed part of the Klima Biennale Wien 2024.
