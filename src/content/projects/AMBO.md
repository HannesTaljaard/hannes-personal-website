Our piano duo specialises in performances that incorporate music and movement
improvisation/composition in various forms. We also present workshops. The members are Aleksandr
Okhotnikov and Hannes Taljaard. We are improvisers, composers, movement artists and educators.
These four roles shape our subprojects, as do our training in the Viennese tradition of music and
movement education. Our first public performance took place in Vienna during the Internationale
Rhythmik Woche Wien in July 2024, and this was followed by a workshop presented in Castelnuovo
del Farfa (Italy) on 21 July 2024 as part of the ArtePiano International Festival and Competition.
