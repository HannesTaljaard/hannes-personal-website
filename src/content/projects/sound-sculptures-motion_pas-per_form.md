This open-ended project focused on collaborative experiences and research under the
guidance of Prof. Stephanie Schroedter. About twenty students from the mdw and the
University for applied Arts (Vienna) explored music, movement and textiles in combination
with inputs from performance art, design, and interactive technology. One of the main aspects
of the project were the movement workshops presented by Ingrid Gappmeier, Ingo Reulecke
and Eva Maria Schaller. I worked as assistant in the organisation, and as improvisor in music
and movement.
