I worked as choreographic assistant for Elisabeth Orlowsky who choreographed the Serenata
and Tarantella from Stravinsky’s Suite Italienne for violin and piano. The choreography of
the Tarantella was performed by a trio of movement artists: Aleksandr Okhotnikov,
Hongshan Bi and Theresa Kanak (with a short appearance by Xavier Duntze – who
performed a solo for the Serenata).
