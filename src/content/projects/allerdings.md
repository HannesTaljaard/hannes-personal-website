The aim of our charitable organisation is to support and develop artistic projects in the field of music
and movement performance. The three founding members are Caterina VÃ¶gel, Antonia Luksch and
Hannes Taljaard. We are all trained in the Viennese tradition of music and movement education and
our subprojects explore the artistic potential of our training. The society was founded in June 2024.
