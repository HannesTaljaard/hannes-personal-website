Performance: November 2024 (Festwoche Musikpädagogik, mdw)
Students from Institute 13 of the mdw will present an improvisation that starts from certain
basic assumptions of 4E cognition. We are exploring and will present music as movement
that is perceived in a multi-sensory way. The relations between body movements/dance and
sound movements will be drawn systematically, and will show ‘interactional asymmetry’.
Our performance will be about interactions that take us into new musical terrain and a
meaningfulness that primarily arises through the sensitizing of perception on the basis of
conceptual understanding. I work as leader of this project together with Prof. Stephanie
Schroedter.
