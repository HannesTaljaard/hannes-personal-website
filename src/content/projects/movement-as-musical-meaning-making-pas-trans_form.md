Students from Institute 13 of the mdw presented an improvisation that started from certain
basic assumptions of 4E cognition. We explored and then presented music as movement
that is perceived in a multi-sensory way. The relations between body movements/dance and
sound movements were drawn systematically, and showed ‘interactional asymmetry’.
Our performance was about interactions that take us into new musical terrain and a
meaningfulness that primarily arises through the sensitizing of perception on the basis of
conceptual understanding. I worked as artistic leader of this project which was under the leadership of Prof. Stephanie
Schroedter, and together with Alexander Okhotnikov as artistic assistant. After the performance in November, we continued our explorations for one more semester.
