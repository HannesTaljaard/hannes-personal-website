My piano etudes are certainly studies for a pianist, and they are also compositional studies, works aimed at developing my composition technique. They might even be considered as studies for listeners. In many of my compositions, I am trying to use **new** languages that were not used by the composers of the past. With these languages, I try to create to some extent the multidimensional processes that makes the music of the past so fascinating. This often involves inventing languages, and inventing new languages is one of the activities that I really love. The setudes, especially the third setude, was analysed and discussed by Bertha Spies in the article *Embodiment, Consciousness and Space-Time: Hannes Taljaard’s Setudes for Piano*.
