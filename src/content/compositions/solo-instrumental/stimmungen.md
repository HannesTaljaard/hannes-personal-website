When one reflects on complex relationships (experienced or observed), one realises that some of the complexity in our lives grow from conflicting emotions that colour and steer our thoughts and interactions. While composing these pieces, I worked with the idea that when dissonances created by conflicting emotions are not resolved they can lead to long-term pervasive moods that deeply influence the ways we feel about and understand ourselves and others. These compositions sing about personal experiences from my life: each composition presents a synthesis of various experiences that can be grouped into the same category.
