During the 1990s I often travelled to Belgium in order to study composition with Wim Henderickx in Antwerp. I had the support of several friends in the town of Lier, close to Antwerp. One day in 1998 the pianist Bart Meuris asked me if I would compose something for a concert that would take place in the “Spuihuis” five weeks later. A very important source of inspiration was the water colour paintings (Nokturnes) by Ronald de Preter, who was living in Lier at that time. His paintings were created at times of the day when the light was almost gone, and from various vantage points in the beautiful town of Lier. I started composing almost immediately after Bart’s request and a few days later Bart could start to prepare the three compositions for the concert. When I play or hear these pieces, I am transported back to many summer evenings in that beautiful town.
