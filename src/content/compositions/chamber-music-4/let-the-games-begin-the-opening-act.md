This composition can be played on one vibraphone and one marimba (by four musicians).

This piece is the introduction to a longer composition which I plan to write for four percussionists and which will include audience interaction in a format similar to a television game show. At least, that has been the plan since 2014! The Opening Act is like a very long ‘jingle’ and it plays with the expectations of the listener, and with Rag music as composed by Scot Joplin. The audience might even hear a few quotations of real Joplin rags. This is not serious music!
