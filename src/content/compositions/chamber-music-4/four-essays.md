The first movement of this composition is analysed by Jaco Meyer in the article The Moving Force of *Gestures: Gestural Transformation in the Serioso from Hannes Taljaard’s Four Essays (2001-2005)* which can be downloaded here. The first two pages of Jaco Meyer’s article give a good introduction to all four Essays.

1. Serioso (c. 8’00”)
2. Intermezzo (c. 5’10”)
3. Scherzo (c. 4’30”)
4. Lyrico (c. 8’00”)
