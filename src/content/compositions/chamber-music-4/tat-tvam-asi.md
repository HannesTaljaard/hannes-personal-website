The title of the work is a Sanskrit expression that can be translated as ‘You are that’. The first movement is marked ‘presto furioso’ and its title is *Krodh-Lobh* (Anger-Greed) while the second movement is ‘piacevole’, titled *Ahimsa: Kshama-Santosha* (Nonviolence: Tolerance-Contentment). I attempt in the first movement to represent the inward dynamics and outward interactions of those that are scattered through the two passions of Anger and Greed. The second movement is an attempt to present the opposite virtues of Tolerance and Contentment, and can be heard as a prayer for ‘Ahimsa’, that state of awareness from which no harm comes to any life form through words, actions or thoughts. This work is a result of my fascination with the displays of consciousness that I have experienced over many years during my interaction with animals. I often reflect about the ways in which human Greed and Anger are harming those creatures who are living more attuned to the virtues than I do. I think of this composition as a memorial for a Great Dane (Dog) named Krieger who was one of the most important friends I’ve had.

Human performers are essential to a piece like *Tat Tvam Asi*. Of course, it can be performed more easily and more ‘perfectly’ by computer. But people should feel about the humans in the ensemble, “how do they do this?”. The listener can be coaxed into self-examination when he/she loosens grip on the music while the performers remain able to keep it together. With electronic sounds this piece would be an interesting surface, but with performers it becomes an interaction, partly through the listeners’ ability to empathise. And exercising the ability to empathise is very important in art. Through empathy we can learn new ways of perceiving, and that can form the basis for building different worlds.
