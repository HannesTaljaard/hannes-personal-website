This composition is an arrangement of two isiZulu lullabies that have been very important to me in a variety of contexts for most of my adult life. Both melodies were also arranged for piano, and I used the melodies and the arrangement often in my teaching.

1. Thula Sthandwa (c. 3’20)
2. Thula Thu’ (c. 3’00”)

Total duration c. 6’30”

#### Thula Sthandwa
Thula, sthandwa sam  

Thula, sthandwa sami  
Thula, sthandwa senhliziyoyami  

Uyise limpela bo ngoba umebile  
Lowo engimthandayo  
Mgenhliziyo yami

<i>Hush, my beloved sweetheart!  
Death, you are a thief for stealing  
the one I love with all my heart!</i>

#### Thula Thu
Thula thu' thula mntwana,  
thula sana.  
Thul' umam' uzofika ekuseni.  

Khukh 'inkanyezi eholol' ubaba,  
Imkhanyisel' indleziy' ekhaya.

<i>Hush hush my child, hush my dearest.  
Quiet now, your mother will be here  
in the morning.

There is a light drawing you,  
Showing you the way home.</i>
