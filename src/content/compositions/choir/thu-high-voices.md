This composition is an arrangement of two isiZulu lullabies that have been very important to me in a variety of contexts for most of my adult life. Both melodies were also arranged for piano, and I used the melodies and the arrangement often in my teaching.

1. Thula Sthandwa (c. 3’20)
2. Thula Thu’ (indefinite duration because of undefined number of repeats, at least one minute)

Total duration at least c. 4’30” (Indefinite because of unspecified repetition)

#### Thula Sthandwa
Thula, sthandwa sam  

Thula, sthandwa sami  
Thula, sthandwa senhliziyoyami  

Uyise limpela bo ngoba umebile  
Lowo engimthandayo  
Mgenhliziyo yami

<i>Hush, my beloved sweetheart!  
Death, you are a thief for stealing  
the one I love with all my heart!</i>

#### Thula Thu
Thula thu' thula mntwana,  
thula sana.  
Thul' umam' uzofika ekuseni.  

Khukh 'inkanyezi eholol' ubaba,  
Imkhanyisel' indleziy' ekhaya.

<i>Hush hush my child, hush my dearest.  
Quiet now, your mother will be here  
in the morning.

There is a light drawing you,  
Showing you the way home.</i>
