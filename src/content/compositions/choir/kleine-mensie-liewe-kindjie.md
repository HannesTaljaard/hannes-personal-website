Parts of the melody of this composition are derived from the tune of a well-known isiZulu lullaby, Thula Thu’. Kleine Mensie, Liewe Kindjie is one of more than ten lullabies that I have composed or arranged until now as a way of exploring the fascinating inwardness/outwardness we experience when singing lullabies. By using parts of a beautiful melody originating in one South African language to express deeply felt personal ideas in another one of our languages (and an original own melody), I hope to contribute to our building a world of understanding and compassion.

Slaap, kleine mensie, slapies!  
Slaap, liewe kindjie, slaap!  
Soos 'n maanligstraal, in 'n wondertaal het jy my kom sê hoe om lief te hê.  
Daarom droom!  
Soos 'n maanligstraal, in 'n wondertaal het jy my kom sê hoe om lief te hê.  
Daarom slaap kleinne mensie, slaap!  
Slaap, liewe kindjie, slaap!

<i>Sleep, little human, sleep!  
Sleep, dear child, sleep!  

Like a moon beam, and in a magic language,  
you came to tell me how to love.  
And for that reason: dream!</i>
