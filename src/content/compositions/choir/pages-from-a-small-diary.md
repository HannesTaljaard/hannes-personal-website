This work is a collection of arrangements of melodies that I love. Every few years I meet a choir or a group of singers/musicians who inspire me, and then I make one of these arrangements as a way to remind me of what happened. And sometimes, a melody is arranged just because it means something to me. I hope to keep adding to this collection for many more years.

#### 1. Wide Water (2014) c. 1’00”
This piece is an arrangement for male quartet and one female voice. Any number of singers can be on each part of the quartet. The female voice can also be performed by a suitable instrument, for example clarinet or saxophone. The upper voice part(s) of the male quartet can also be performed by female singers. It is an arrangement of the well-known English folk song.

The water is wide, I cannot cross o'er; and neither have I wings to fly.

So, give me a boat that will carry two, and both shall row, my love and I.

#### 2. Slapikanini (2014) c. 1’00”
This South African lullaby is arranged here for three female voices. If the choir includes male voices, these singers double the lowest voice one octave lower in some passages. I have known this melody my whole life, because it is one of the lullabies that my mother used to sing to us. If I remember correctly, I wrote the text for the second verse.

Sleep, Pikanini, our animals are safe for the  
night – all the sheep and all the goats.

Tomorrow early you will have a meal made of sweet  
flour, and a pair of white socks.

Sleep, Pikanini, our grain is stored safely so  
that we will not suffer any losses.

Tomorrow early we will let the animals graze  
again, and then you and I can talk some more.

#### 3. Für die Zeit, anderswo (2018) c. 2’30”
This is a complex arrangement for mixed choir in eight voices of a well-known German folk song that was published by Johannes Brahms in a version for solo voice and piano.

Da unten im Tale läufts Wasser so trüb und i kann dirs nit sagen, i hab di so lieb.

Sprichst allweil von Lieb, sprichst allweill von
Treu, und a bissele Falschheit is au wohl dabei.
Und wenn i dirs zehnmal sagt das i di lieb,
un du willst nit verstehen, muss i halt weiter gehen.

Für die Zeit wo du g'liebt mi hast, dank i dir schön, und i wünsch, dass dirs anderswo, besser mag gehn.

<i>Down in the valley the murky waters flow,
and I cannot tell you how much I love you.

You are always speaking about love and loyalty, and some deceit is always included.
And when I tell you ten times that I love you, you will not understand, and I will have to go my way.

For the time that you loved me, I thank you, and I wish for you that you may find better fortune elsewhere.</i>

#### 4. Christine Wiegelied (2021) duration indefinite, likely about 8’30”

This is an original composition for two voice parts and one or more cellos. The cello line can also be sung by very low basses. The upper vocal part can be sung by all female voices (or by sopranos only), and the lower part by high male voices (or by altos).

The text of this composition is in Afrikaans, and very simple: “Slaap, my kindjie, slaap!” (Sleep, my little child, sleep!) The piece uses three twelve-tone melodies, but the simple three-part texture uses consonant triads. The piece is in three sections, and each section can be repeated as many times as the choir wishes. Christine Pichler studied BA with me in Vienna, and she was the one who first had the idea of composing a lullaby using a twelve-tone row.
