In Afrikaans we use the word “kammaland” to refer to an imagined place, and the word “kammakamma” to indicate that we are pretending (without the intention to deceive). I added ‘Book 1’ to the title, because the intention to arrange more of the folk songs that I grew up with, was very strong in the year 2004.
