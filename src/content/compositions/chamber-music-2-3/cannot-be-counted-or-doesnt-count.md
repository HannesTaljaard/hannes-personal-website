The title of this composition and of the related composition for Saxophone and Piano are based on a quote which is usually attributed to Albert Einstein: "Not everything that can be counted counts, and not everything that counts can be counted."

These compositions can be performed separately, and when performed together there are two orders possible.

The compositions for saxophone are based upon the compositions for clarinet, and my aim was to try to show my understanding of how the two different instruments can be different – even though the exact same repertoire can often actually be performed on both clarinet and saxophone.

Cannot be counted c. 4’35” to 5 minutes – depending on improvised cadenza  
Doesn’t count c. 5 minutes
