The title of this composition and of the related composition for Clarinet and Piano are based on a quote which is usually attributed to Albert Einstein: "Not everything that can be counted counts, and not everything that counts can be counted."

I wanted to write virtuoso pieces for both performers, which would challenge and reward them and the listeners. Before and during the process of composing these pieces, I often studied clarinet tutors, to broaden my imagination of textures for clarinet. These compositions can be performed separately, and when performed together there are two orders possible.

All that can be counted c. 5 minutes  
All that counts c. 4’30”
