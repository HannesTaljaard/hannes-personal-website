This composition is the second in the group of compositions called 'Worldsmiths'.

In the ways that we build dwellings, art galleries, temples or universities; in the ways that we make clothes, sculptures, poems or gardens (and so on) it seems that we create worlds and then try to persuade others that this world is worthy of existence, or even better than another world.

So, we can read into many of our actions a motivation that says ‘while we are making worlds, we are trying to persuade others of these worlds’. We also do this with our words: it happens in teaching, praying and in everyday conversations. I thought that it would be an interesting experiment to see if I can create music that is not quite what people expect to hear from the piano and one string instrument. Could I create it in such a way that I could persuade or convince people that music could be like this, that it could exist like this?
