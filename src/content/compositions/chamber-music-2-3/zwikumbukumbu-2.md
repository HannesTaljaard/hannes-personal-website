This composition is a collection, and any number of songs can be performed in any order. The pieces are arrangements of traditional Tshivenda songs, and some of them are reworked versions of the arrangements for voice and piano. Venda is the part of South Africa where I was born, and where I lived for the first five years of my life. The songs, and others from the same culture, hold a very special place in my heart.

The melodies and information on the melodies are published in the book Venda lashu: Tshivenda songs, musical games and songs stories, compiled and edited by Jaco Kruger (2004). ISBN 1-86822-430-9.

Some of the arrangements were recorded by the Duo ‘Fast Company’ (Andrea Bressan, bassoon & Saverio Tasca, percussion). For more information, go [here](/recordings).
