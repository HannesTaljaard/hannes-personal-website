In some ways, these short pieces are preparatory studies for Riturnelli. They work with similar intentions, but on a smaller scale and more simply. These pieces are light, full of light, and hopefully delightful. I sometimes try to imagine how a French Harpsichord player from the time of Couperin would react to hearing these pieces.

1. Prelude c. 2’10
2. Courante & Sarabande c. 4’50” & c. 2 minutes

Total duration: c. 9 minutes
