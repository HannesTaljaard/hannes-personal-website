This work was composed for the Trio Auturja: Taner Türker, Harald Haslinger and Junko Tsuchiya, and it was first performed by them on 12 August 2025 in Vienna. The composition is an instrumentation of the two lasts songs from my song cycle for baritone and piano, titled <i>Rare Kinnerjare</i>. Both songs present ‘small entries’ into the complex worlds created by the feelings that parents have for their children.

The first song flow without pause into the second one. However, the two songs can also be performed separately.
1. Troetelwoorde (c.4’40”)
2. Poppedol (c.4’30”)

Total duration c. 9’10”
