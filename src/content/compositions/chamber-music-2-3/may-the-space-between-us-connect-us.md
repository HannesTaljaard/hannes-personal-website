This work is a newer version of two movements (originally for soprano and violin) of Arie Antiche, Libretto 1. The pieces can be performed separately, and when they are performed together, they should be presented in this order. The pieces are recompositions of familiar repertoire for singers, music that I’ve learned during the years when accompanying singers were one of the great joys of my life.

1. Aria c. 5’30”
2. Fantasy c. 14’30”

#### Aria: Bist Du Du
*If you are with me, I will go peacefully. Let it be your beautiful hands that close my faithful eyes.*

My beloved, the desire of my heart… You, my beloved.*
