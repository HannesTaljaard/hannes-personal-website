The composition is in the style of Scott Joplin’s Piano Rags, and is based upon three South African
folk songs (of which the words are in Afrikaans). It is not easy to recognise the original folk songs.
The piece is a brisk Rondo of which the refrain is upbeat and lively. During the episodes some
orchestra members change places with others, in order to create a lively interaction that matches the
music. I have written “rules of the game” for the interaction, but these can be adapted, or new rules
can be invented. It is also possible to perform the composition as a standard orchestral work, with
every musician remaining in place.
