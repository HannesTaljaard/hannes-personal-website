Hannes Taljaard’s string quartet Four Essaysis a quintessential work in the South African string
quartet literature. Various layers of ambivalence and ambiguity in this work make it a cognitively rich
work to listeners and analysts. This article is an analysis of the first movement, Serioso, that shows
the composer’s complex compositional technique against the backdrop of influences of metaphors in
music, Indian Music and Bharatanatyam, musical gestures, musical forces, Set Theory, French poetry,
and lullabies. As with many creative individuals, their lives and their creative outputs are mutually
shaped. That is one of the fundamental aspects that are elucidated through the analysis presented in
this article. I focus mainly on the thematic material of the work and statements that are based on what
Taljaard refers to as the ‘protostatement’.
