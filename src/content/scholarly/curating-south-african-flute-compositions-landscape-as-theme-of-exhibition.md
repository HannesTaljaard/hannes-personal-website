This study explores intersections between curatorship, South African flute compositions in concert
practice and ‘landscape’ as theme of exhibition for concert events. The investigation into these
intersections is informed by artistic research […] The research contends that curating as theoretical
framework, but also as interventionist practice that is context-sensitive, is able to inform and
invigorate conventional concert practices in the exhibition of South African flute compositions. […] In
these curations I play the flute, an instrument that is traditionally and mythologically associated with
the pastoral, but through my concert curations I perhaps find ‘An Other Tongue’, as Walter Mignolo
suggests decolonial aestheSis is able to instigate. This research project demonstrates the power of the
flute and its Western scored notations to intervene, transform and be transformed locally amidst
curations that are context sensitive. Ultimately, the research is concerned with the possibilities
presented by artistic research.
