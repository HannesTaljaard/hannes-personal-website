[…] Works by more than 75 composers are listed in alphabetical order according to the composer’s
surname. Each composer’s works are listed chronologically according to date of composition.
Although this document lists more than 180 works for string quartet, as well as a few significant
works for string quartet with one or two other voices, this document should not be regarded as fully
comprehensive. Each catalogue inscription consists of the name, birth year and birth place of the
composer; country of residence, if not in South Africa; publishing details of the composer, where
applicable; contact details of the composer; title of work and year of composition; dedicatee and
commission, where applicable; approximate duration; titles of movements; details of first
performance; details of recordings; notes (annotations). The catalogue is preceded by a succinct
historic overview of the development of the string quartet as a medium, as well as a timeline of
composers of string quartets in South Africa. A short chapter explaining the annotation process is
included. The research document concludes with suggestions for further investigation.
