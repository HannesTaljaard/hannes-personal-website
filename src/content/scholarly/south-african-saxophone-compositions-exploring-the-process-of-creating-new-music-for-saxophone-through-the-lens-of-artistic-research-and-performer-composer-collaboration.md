Globally, there is a substantial body of repertoire for the classical saxophone. In South Africa,
however, compositions for the classical saxophone by national composers are in short supply. This
research investigated possible reasons for the limited compositional output of the instrument in this
genre in South Africa. […] The interviews provided invaluable insight into the context within which
the classical saxophone is situated in South Africa, where it is viewed as an instrument commonly
used in jazz performance. The lack of saxophone-specific pedagogical resources, the high cost of
commissions and the small number of classically-trained saxophone specialists country-wide, are all
factors which limit the number of classical saxophone performers and repertoire. […] In the absence
of a commissioning guide in South Africa, participants in the study shared their methods of
commissioning works and their reasons for doing so. The data revealed that the role of national
festivals and competitions are powerful conduits for promoting South African music. The participants
shared their hopes and opinions for the future of the classical saxophone. Finally, the researcher
created a draft catalogue of existing classical saxophone works to complement the fragmented
databases found during the course of this research.
