This article analyses and discusses some of the characteristics of two sets of piano arrangements of
traditional lullabies by the South African composer Hannes Taljaard (1971-). The deceptively simple
arrangements in Two lullabies (2001) and Zwikumbu Zwingana (2010) feature interesting
accompaniments, colourful harmony and the alteration of melodic contours, as well as metric and
harmonic instability and the avoidance of clear cadences.
