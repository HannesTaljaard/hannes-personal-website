This tribute to the music of Hannes Taljaard, more specifically his Setudes for piano, takes sensory
cognition as its point of departure. The performer’s immediate embodiment of the music and the
intuitive auditory awareness of the listening experience facilitate two different ways of perceiving and
understanding a kind of music that is not aligned with traditional tonal structures and processes.
Insight into the composer’s craft as a vehicle for artistic expression represents a third route towards
understanding. Allowing for diverse overlapping of actions, the kinetic-tactile connection with music
during performance and unmediated experience that allows music to speak directly to the listener’s
consciousness recreate the composition, thereby completing Ernst Gombrich’s ‘magic circle of
creation’. Sensory experience is linked with the idea of craftmanship in the service of the art by
finally considering the composer’s shaping of music in time and space. This essay deals with the
fourdimensional concept of space-time in the discussion of Taljaard’s Setudes in order to show how
the static idea of the moment is transformed into the dynamic idea of becoming in musical perception.
