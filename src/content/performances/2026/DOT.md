Our site-specific performance which lasted 45 minutes was the culmination of a three-day reharsal process with Christine Pichler as project leader. We 'recreated' the opening ceremony of the 1936 Olympic Games in Berlin as a way to question history contemporary events, and specifically the lagacies of artists who participated in the event in 1936. Christine's theoretical framework centred on the notions of Hegemony, Biography and Performativity.
