Trio Auturja will present the first performance of a work that I created for them: a new trio consisting of arrangements of two songs, originally for Baritone and piano, from my song Cycle *Rare Kinnerjare*. They will also play music by Mozart, Beethoven, Schubert and Rota. This concert is part the series *Sommerkonzerte 2025*.
