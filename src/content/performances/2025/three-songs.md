Trio Auturja presented the first performance of a work that I composed for them: a new trio consisting of arrangements of two songs, originally for Baritone and piano, from my song Cycle *Rare Kinnerjare*. They also played music by Mozart, Beethoven, Schubert and Rota. This concert was part the series *Sommerkonzerte 2025*. A live recording of one of the two songs can be heard on <a href="https://youtu.be/K9jy-AUzTJY?si=vlLQZ5dL3WnpDCQN"  target="_blank">Youtube.</a>
