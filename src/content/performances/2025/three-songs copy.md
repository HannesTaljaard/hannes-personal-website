Trio Auturja will perform again this work that I composed for them. They will play this trio consisting of arrangements of two songs, originally for Baritone and piano, from my song Cycle *Rare Kinnerjare* during a concert titled <i>Grenzenlos - Klangwelten für drei</i>. A live recording of one of the two songs can be heard on <a href="https://youtu.be/K9jy-AUzTJY?si=vlLQZ5dL3WnpDCQN"  target="_blank">Youtube.</a>
